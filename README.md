BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has faced revenue losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and now aims to develop a data-driven strategy to boost post-lockdown demand. They seek insights into the factors influencing bike demand to help differentiate themselves from competitors and capitalize on future market needs. A consulting company has been hired to analyze various factors affecting daily bike demand across the American market. This analysis will help identify key variables that significantly impact demand and explain how they relate to bike usage. The resulting model will enable BoomBikes to tailor its business strategies to meet expected customer demand and thrive in the market.
